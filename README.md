# ScarletUI

ScarletUI is a declarative UI framework for Scarlet applications. The public
application crate is `scarlet-ui`; implementation and platform backends are
split into local crates so the UI core does not depend on SWS or desktop window
libraries.

The application API is platform-agnostic: application code declares scenes and
calls `app.run()`. Platform selection is a crate feature decision, not an app
runtime decision. Internally the selected backend is passed to the runner as a
`Box<dyn PlatformBackend>`, so backend selection can later move to runtime
without changing the UI core.

## Features

- **Declarative views**: compose UI with `View` values and container macros.
- **State management**: `State<T>` drives rebuild, layout, paint, and composite.
- **Scene model**: `Application::scenes()` declares top-level windows.
- **Multi-window runtime**: each opened window owns its own rendering pipeline.
- **Platform abstraction**: SWS and native desktop platforms share the same runner.
- **Text input**: keyboard, character input, IME preedit/commit, and focus sync.

## Platform Features

`scarlet-ui` currently selects one platform feature per build. The feature pulls
in the matching backend crate; `scarlet-ui-core` itself never depends on
`sws-client`, `sws-protocol`, `winit`, or `softbuffer`.

| Feature | Target | Notes |
|---------|--------|-------|
| `platform-sws` | Scarlet OS / SWS | Default platform feature. Pulls in `scarlet-ui-platform-sws`, which uses `sws-client` and `sws-protocol`. |
| `platform-winit` | native desktop | Pulls in `scarlet-ui-platform-winit`, which uses `winit` and `softbuffer`; requires `std`. |

The default feature set is:

```toml
default = ["std", "platform-sws"]
```

For native desktop builds, depend on ScarletUI with `platform-winit`:

```toml
[target.'cfg(not(target_os = "scarlet"))'.dependencies]
scarlet-ui = { path = "crates/scarlet-ui", default-features = false, features = ["std", "platform-winit"] }
```

For Scarlet OS `std`-compatible builds, use `platform-sws`:

```toml
[target.'cfg(target_os = "scarlet")'.dependencies]
scarlet-ui = { path = "crates/scarlet-ui", default-features = false, features = ["std", "platform-sws"] }
```

For no-std user binaries using Scarlet's legacy std shim, use:

```toml
scarlet-ui = { path = "crates/scarlet-ui", default-features = false, features = ["legacy-scarlet-std", "platform-sws"] }
```

`platform-sws` and `platform-winit` are mutually exclusive. `std` and
`legacy-scarlet-std` are also mutually exclusive.

## Crate Layout

```text
apps / user bins
  |
  v
scarlet-ui
  |-- re-exports scarlet-ui-core
  |-- ApplicationRunExt::run()
  |-- scarlet-ui-platform-sws    [feature: platform-sws]
  |   |-- scarlet-ui-core
  |   |-- sws-client
  |   `-- sws-protocol
  `-- scarlet-ui-platform-winit  [feature: platform-winit]
      |-- scarlet-ui-core
      |-- winit
      `-- softbuffer

scarlet-ui-core
  |-- View / Element / Scene / Pipeline
  |-- rendering and preview core
  |-- PlatformBackend trait
  |-- PlatformWindow trait
  `-- WindowCreateRequest
```

Dependency direction is intentionally one-way:

```text
scarlet-ui-platform-sws  ----.
                             v
apps --> scarlet-ui ---> scarlet-ui-core
                             ^
scarlet-ui-platform-winit ---'
```

`scarlet-ui-core` owns the UI implementation and backend traits. Platform crates
only implement those traits. The `scarlet-ui` facade preserves the app-facing
`scarlet_ui` crate name and selects the backend crate from features.

## Live Preview

ScarletUI preview is a native desktop development tool. It is separate from the
normal application runtime: application binaries still call `app.run()`, and
platform selection remains a build feature.

A preview crate marks one or more view functions with `#[scarlet_ui::preview]`.
The function can return a view fragment directly; a `Window` wrapper is only
needed when the preview wants to exercise window-specific behavior. Stateful
previews should return the state-owning view itself so its `listenables()` stay
mounted; do not return an already-expanded fragment that has read `State::get()`.
For binary crates, a simple `[lib] path = "src/main.rs"` target keeps preview
setup minimal.

```rust
use scarlet_ui::prelude::*;

#[scarlet_ui::preview(width = 420.0, height = 260.0)]
fn counter_preview() -> impl View + Clone {
    CounterPreview::default()
}

#[scarlet_ui::preview]
fn button_preview() -> impl View + Clone {
    Button::new("OK")
}
```

Preview names are generated from function names, such as `counter_preview` to
`Counter Preview`. `#[scarlet_ui::preview(name = "...")]` is available only when
an explicit display name is useful.

Run the native preview host against that crate:

```bash
cargo run --manifest-path tools/preview/Cargo.toml -- \
  --manifest-path examples/preview-demo/Cargo.toml
```

Select a specific preview by generated name or stable ID:

```bash
cargo run --manifest-path tools/preview/Cargo.toml -- \
  --manifest-path examples/preview-demo/Cargo.toml \
  --preview "Button Preview"
```

The host rebuilds and reloads the preview dylib when Rust source or Cargo files
change. Preview dylibs use Rust ABI and must be built by the same toolchain as
the host.

Use `--build-only` to verify the preview dylib without opening a window.

```bash
cargo run --manifest-path tools/preview/Cargo.toml -- \
  --manifest-path examples/preview-demo/Cargo.toml \
  --build-only
```

## Basic Application

```rust
use scarlet_ui::prelude::*;
use scarlet_ui::{hstack, vstack};
use scarlet_ui_macros::View;

#[derive(View, Clone, Default)]
struct CounterApp {
    count: State<i32>,
}

impl CounterApp {
    fn content(&self) -> impl View {
        vstack! {
            Text::new("Counter").font_size(24.0),
            Text::new(format!("Count: {}", self.count.get())),
            hstack! {
                Button::new("-").on_click({
                    let count = self.count.clone();
                    move || count.set(count.get() - 1)
                }),
                Button::new("+").on_click({
                    let count = self.count.clone();
                    move || count.set(count.get() + 1)
                }),
            },
        }
        .spacing(12.0)
        .padding(EdgeInsets::all(16.0))
    }
}

impl Application for CounterApp {
    fn scenes(&self) -> impl Scene {
        WindowGroup::new(
            "main",
            Window::new("Counter", self.content())
                .app_id("org.scarlet-os.counter")
                .size(Size::new(400.0, 300.0)),
        )
    }
}

fn main() -> scarlet_ui::Result<()> {
    let mut app = CounterApp::default();
    app.run()
}
```

## Application Model

`Application::scenes()` is the application UI entry point. `body()` is still used
by `#[derive(View)]` for reusable view components, but it is not the top-level
application entry point.

Each scene declaration produces a top-level `Window`. At runtime, ScarletUI
creates one `WindowSlot` per opened window:

```text
Application::scenes()
  -> Scene declarations
  -> ApplicationRunner
  -> Box<dyn PlatformBackend>
  -> WindowSlot { WindowId, PipelineId, RenderingPipeline, PlatformWindow }
```

Application code should not choose or name a platform implementation. It imports the
normal ScarletUI prelude and calls `app.run()`.

## Platform Integration

Platform code lives behind `PlatformBackend` and `PlatformWindow`. These traits
are public so backend crates can implement them, but they are runner boundaries,
not normal application APIs. They create windows, poll events, present buffers,
route text input, and handle window controls.

Most applications should not construct a `PlatformWindow` directly. Use
`Window`, `WindowGroup`, `open_window`, `dismiss_window`, and `app.run()`.

SWS-specific applications may use lifecycle hooks and downcast the
`dyn PlatformWindow` only when they intentionally depend on SWS-specific
capabilities.

## Development Commands

Run facade tests:

```bash
cargo test -p scarlet-ui --lib --tests
```

Run core tests and doctests:

```bash
cargo test -p scarlet-ui-core
```

Check native desktop support and preview tooling:

```bash
cargo check -p scarlet-ui --no-default-features --features std,platform-winit,preview
cargo check -p scarlet-ui-platform-winit
cargo check -p scarlet-ui-preview
```

Check the Scarlet OS / SWS backend against the sibling Scarlet checkout:

```bash
cargo check -p scarlet-ui-platform-sws --no-default-features --features legacy-scarlet-std
```

Run the preview demo:

```bash
cargo run -p scarlet-ui-preview -- \
  --manifest-path examples/preview-demo/Cargo.toml \
  --preview "Counter Preview"
```

Check a Scarlet consumer after this repo is wired into Scarlet:

```bash
cd ../Scarlet/user/bin
cargo check --bin terminal --target ../targets/aarch64-unknown-scarlet-elf.json
```

## Design Documents

- `docs/graphics/scarletui/design.md`
- `docs/graphics/scarletui/api.md`

## Local Scarlet Dependencies

The SWS backend currently depends on sibling Scarlet checkout crates by path:

```text
../Scarlet/user/lib/std
../Scarlet/user/lib/sws-client
../Scarlet/user/lib/sws-protocol
```

Keep this repository next to `Scarlet` for local development:

```text
Development/Rust/
  Scarlet/
  scarlet-ui/
```

When Scarlet gets a root Cargo workspace that exposes those packages, these path
references can be replaced with git dependencies on `petitstrawberry/Scarlet`.
